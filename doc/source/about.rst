`Xlearn <https://github.com/tomography/xlearn>`_ implements Computational Neural Network to
X-ray science imaging problems including:

* Correction of instrument and beam instability artifacts
  
  Tomographic reconstructions often contains various types of artefacts due to misalignment, instrument instabilities, detector non linear response, bright spot in the projection images etc. `Xlearn <https://github.com/tomography/xlearn>`_ implements Computational Neural Network to reduce or mitigate tomographic reconstruction artefacts.


* Feature extraction, segmentation
